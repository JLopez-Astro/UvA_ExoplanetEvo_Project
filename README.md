# UvA_ExoplanetEvo_Project
A project from the Exoplanet Evolution course at the University of Amsterdam. The task was to model exoplanet atmospheres for planets of varying characteristics using the PICASO exoplanet atmosphere modeling package (https://natashabatalha.github.io/picaso/). The explanation of each model can be found in the included PDF file.
